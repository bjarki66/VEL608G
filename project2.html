									<h2>Project 2:</h2>
									<p>Laser cut leg assembly for a tripod.</p>
								</header>
                                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                                <p>For projects 2 and 3, I decided to make two seperate components of a single assembly, that being an adjustable tripod
                                for a mobile phone. The mount, which is designed to be a camera mount, is made up of a laser cut leg assembly, and a 3D printed
                                bracket for holding the phone.</p>
                                <p>Project 2 will mostly focus on the leg assembly, although the 3D printed bracket features as a structural element, and will be 
                                referenced when applicable.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <h2>Step 1: Design parameters:</h2>
								<p>Given the available materials, the design was made with 4mm plywood in mind, with all dimensions being derived from the thickness of the material. The total 
                                height of the leg assembly is 100mm in that case, although, for structural reasons, the optimal thickness would likely be closer to 6mm, with the final height being
                                around 160mm.</p>
                                <p>Since the design is parameterized based on material thickness, all relevant calculations will be done as functions of "t", with results being based on t = 4.</p>
                                
                                <p>For simplicity's sake, being a tripod, the design is radially symmetrical, with the leg geometry, as well as total geometry based on trigonometry. That means 
                                each leg of the tripod will be relative to a triangle of base with (B) = 15t, and base height (H) = 25t. Below are shown the most relevant parameters, although other dimensions
                                will be based on thickness, and will be referrenced when applicable.</p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project2/Step02b_design_parameters.jpg" style="width: 60%;max-height: 60%"></p>
                                
                                
                                
								<h2>Step 2: Leg geometry</h2>
                                
                                <p>As previously stated, the geometry of the legs are based on a triangle with a base width (B) of 15t and base height (H) of 25t. At the bottom of each leg is a cut-out for a circular
                                base, and at the top a notch where the bracket for the phone snaps on, providing additional structural support for the leg assembly, as well as stability for the phone itself.</p>
                                
                                <p>The size of the bracket determines the location of the centre line for the whole assembly, from which the radial symmetry of the legs is derrived. The location
                                of the centre line was derrived from:</p>
                                <p>Bracket with = 6t<br>
                                Centre line = Bracket with/2 + B = 18t</p>
                                
                                <p>To provide stability on rough surfaces, each leg will have a circular base underneath it, which requires a bit of added material (2.5t in height from the base)
                                for structural soundness. Below is the initial drawing for each leg of the assembly.</p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project2/Step03_pod_sketch.jpg" style="width: 40%;max-height: 40%"></p>
                                
                                <h2> Step 3: Radial symmetry</h2>
                                
                                <p>The inital leg drawing was extruded to thickness t, and then Fusion's built-in radial symmetry feature was used to place the remaining 2 legs, based on the 
                                    location of the centre line</p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project2/Step05_tripod_set_up.jpg" style="width: 40%;max-height: 40%"></p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 4: Axial stabilizer</h2>
                                
                                <p>The legs, being fairly thin, and with only one point of contact at the top, require both additional torsional strength, as well as a second point of contact to be made stable.
                                The solution to that problem was determined to be a circular "axial stabilizer", which is press-fitted to the legs, and provides support, both downwards, as well as keeping 
                                pressure off the snap points at the top of the assembly. The axial stabilizer is located at 2/3 of the total height of the leg assembly.</p>
                                
                                
                                <p>The dimensions of the axial stabilizer were calculated as follows:</p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    
                                    tan(theta) = B/H = 0.6 <br>
                                    total length to centre line = 0.6*2.5t + B + Bracket_width/2 = 19.5t <br>
                                    total height = 1/0.6 * 19.5t = 32.5t <br>
                                    outer radius = 0.6 * total height * 2/3 = 13t <br>
                                    inner radius = outer radius - width of leg/2 (4t/2) = 11t
                                
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>A hexagonal shape was then cut into the stabilizer, for weight saving, and aesthetic reasons. The hexagonal shape was chosen due to it being a very stable shape, and for the
                                    fact it fits perfectly with the triangular shape of the tripod's structure, as well as being easy to cut, compared to more complicated skeletonizing structures. </p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project2/Step06_axial_stabilizer_bestagon.jpg" style="width: 40%;max-height: 40%"></p>
                                
                                <p>The stabilizer's dimensions were locked in using the calculations for innner- and outer radii, and the stabilizer then moved into place. The cuts on the inital legs was
                                achieved using Fusion's built in function "Combine".</p>

                                <h2>Step 4: Feet</h2>
                                
                                <p>As stated above the design required base plates for each leg, for use on uneaven ground, the design is simply based on the earlier drawing for the legs, with each
                                plate being the same diameter as the center bracket.</p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project2/Step08_Tarantino.jpg" style="width: 40%;max-height: 40%"></p>
                                
                                <p>The base plates were then moved into shape, resulting in the final design of the tripod assembly</p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project2/tripod_final.jpg" style="width: 40%;max-height: 40%"></p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 5: Preparation for cutting</h2>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project2/Step081_Component_copy.jpg" style="width: 40%;max-height: 40%"></p>
                                
                                <p>To prepare for laser cutting, all relevant bodies of the model were moved to a new component named "CAD Layout". The bodies were then changed to 
                                    individual components, and roughly arrange using the Fusion built-in command "Align". The cutting surface was based on the maximum cutting surface of the laser cutter (1000mm*500mm), and the components were arranged within that area using the built-in "Arrange" function.</p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project2/Step083_Arrangement.jpg" style="width: 40%;max-height: 40%"></p>
                                
                                <p>The model is then moved into the "Manufacture" workspace, and tool paths set up. Using the "setup" feature, the components are located on the cutting stock, with 
                                the geometry of the stock being set up as relative to the component layout from earlier, but offset on the X- and Y-axies by 10mm, to account for imperfections at the
                                edges of the material.</p>
                                
                                <p>The final geometry of the stock is calculated to be approximately 124mm x 283mm, assuming a thickness of 4mm, although the size may vary based on the measured 
                                    thickness of the stock at manufacture.</p>
                                
                                <p>Due to linking constraints, a slight adjustment was required. The program could not find a tool path where one of the legs was cut from inside the hexagonal
                                cutout for the stabilizer, resulting in slight material wastage. Once the error had been fixed, a tool path could be set up.</p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project2/Step084b_Face_selection.jpg" style="width: 40%;max-height: 40%"></p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 6: Kerf compensation</h2>
                                
                                <p>To ensure proper fitting of the press fit components, kerf must be accounted for. That requires offsetting the tool paths by the width of the laser, so that
                                    the original dimensions of the design are conserved. The laser cutting feature in Fusion automatically accounts for kerf, assuming the correct kerf width for 
                                    the laser cutter is provided.</p>
