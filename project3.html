									<h2>Project 3:</h2>
									<p>Ball joint with bracket</p>
								</header>
                                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                                <p>For projects 2 and 3, I decided to make two seperate components of a single assembly, that being an adjustable tripod
                                for a mobile phone. The mount, which is designed to be a camera mount, is made up of a laser cut leg assembly, and a 3D printed
                                bracket for holding the phone.</p>
                                <p>Project 3 will focus mostly on the 3D printed bracket, although the leg assembly from Project 2 may be referenced when applicable.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 1: Design parameters</h2>
                                <p>Much of the design is still based off the thickness variable from project 2, although the ball joint itself, and the mounting bracket are of a defined absolute size,
                                with the ball joint being of a fixed radius, and the bracket being constrained directly to the ball joint. This was done both to stay within the allowed mass limit, 
                                and to ensure that the bracket would fit the size of a normal phone.</p>
                                
                                <p>The assembly also uses a couple of external components, those being a 4mm bolt, and nut, as well as a rubber band, which are required to fit for the product to
                                be functional.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 2: Bracket base</h2>
                                <p>The base of the bracket is hexaognal, which means it fits with the flat surfaces on the tripod, while it still being possible to twist the shape to lock it 
                                into place. The shape was extruded to the same length as the flat sides of the tripod, and the inside hollowed out to minimize material use and weight.</p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project3/Step09_initial_bracket_setup.jpg" style="width: 60%;max-height: 60%"></p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 3: Snap-on arms</h2>
                                <p>The bracket was then fitted with snap-on arms, which lock into the notches on the legs. Each armature features a small lip, which locks the components into place,
                                and keeps the assembly from easily breaking apart.</p>
                                
                                <p><img class="scale down" src="images/project3/Step10_bracket_arm_pattern.jpg" style="width: 60%;max-height: 60%"></p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 4: Ball joint</h2>
                                <p>At the top of the base is added a neck, topped with a sphere that will serve as the "ball" part of the ball joint. </p>
